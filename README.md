Abstract:
Financial markets and modern trading systems utilize thousands of different indicators to capture all potential market signals across multiple dimensions. However, high-dimensionality introduces substantial redundancy and noise, necessitating robust dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques. Traditional linear dimensionality reduction methods struggle to capture nonlinear behaviors, such as superposition and entanglement, leading to poorly represented data and loss of information. Indicators are dependent on one another, as well as follow unstable factors like impulse, momentum, and sentiment interactions. This paper introduces a quantum-inspired nonlinear approach to compress these trading indicators while taking into account their complex interdependence.
This work will make two key contributions to the emerging bridge between machine learning and quantitative finance. We establish performance baselines for quantum-inspired DR techniques in financial forecasting, demonstrating their viability relative to classical approaches. And we present a framework to reduce overfitting, making it applicable to generalized dimensionality reduction research. Our empirical results demonstrate modest but statistically significant predictive performance across all methods. We document the limitations of current methods, particularly their inability to adapt to structural breaks, and we identify clear directions for future extensions, including Bayesian structural break detection, ensemble-based DR pipelines, and interpretable tools (SHAP, LIME) for inexperienced users.

Background:
When algorithmic traders use models to identify patterns in stocks, they must consider the issue of dimensionality. The volume of these models increases exponentially when more input is added, leading to extremely low density and sparse data. Most algorithms cannot find patterns when data is sparse, leading to overfitting. Also, due to the quantum relationships between indicators, it is crucial to ensure neighboring sets of data are close enough to take their interdependence into account.
Our approach applies a nonlinear quantum-inspired dimensionality reduction framework to (NVIDIA) stock data. We will compare the 5-day forecasting performance of our method against 3 DR baselines: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA, and Autoencoders, which integrate the following machine-learning models: Ridge Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting. All models are trained using a time-series cross-validation protocol with objective thresholds from quantitative finance literature to prevent look-ahead bias. (random baseline: 50% accuracy; institutional-grade: Sharpe ratio > 2.0).
Linear methods often cannot get the true scope of the market structure for two main reasons. The first is that the linear assumptions are made based on fixed indicators. Traditional methods like PCA, which only capture the variance between data, do not express the underlying market structure. They tend to make assumptions based on memorization and completely disregard any patterns that drive price behavior. The curves become more pixelated and have less margin for error. It is important to note that high variance comes from high volatility, so many times, linear methods can only convey extreme conditions. They are also unable to predict the market accurately if there are new conditions or factors in play. The second limit of linear methods is the extent to which these methods can predict. Algorithmic trading is relatively new, so there is not much historical data for linear methods to use as input. This short-term pattern recognition will not recognize the broader aspects of the curve.
The biggest concern for any algorithmic trader is the amount of computational power they have in their arsenal. Autoencoders and t-SNE require supercomputers and are extremely difficult to interpret by normal people. Linear methods tend to be less computationally heavy, hence they are much more widely used by traders. This research aims to bring a middle ground, exploring quantum-inspired dimensionality reduction, in order to bring accessibility for these powerful quantitative trading techniques. 
Quantum-inspired dimensionality reduction offers a new approach to capturing the complex, nonlinear structure of financial markets. By mimicking the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement, this framework can represent multiple interacting financial states simultaneously within a compact feature space. It encodes correlations and dependencies between market features, such as momentum, volatility, and liquidity, without requiring massive data or computing resources. The motivation behind this approach is to make powerful, information-rich feature representations accessible not only to large institutions but also to individual quantitative traders. In doing so, quantum-inspired dimensionality reduction has the potential to democratize advanced algorithmic trading, enabling more efficient decision-making in high-dimensional financial environments.
This work will make two key contributions to the emerging bridge between machine learning and quantitative finance. We establish performance baselines for quantum-inspired DR techniques in financial forecasting, demonstrating their viability relative to classical approaches. We present a framework to reduce overfitting, making it applicable to generalized dimensionality reduction research. We document the limitations of current methods, particularly their inability to adapt to structural breaks, and we identify clear directions for extensions, including Bayesian structural break detection, ensemble-based DR pipelines, and explainability tools (SHAP, LIME) for interpretable trading signals.
Future work will explore three critical extensions: (1) integrating structural break detection methods to model regime-dependent feature behavior, (2) developing ensemble DR frameworks that adaptively weight methods based on market conditions, and (3) enhancing model interpretability to facilitate deployment in institutional trading environments. As quantum computing hardware matures, these algorithmic foundations will enable scalable implementations of quantum-native DR techniques for real-time financial applications.

Dimensionality Reduction in Machine Learning:
Dimensionality reduction is a crucial component in machine learning, especially in settings where dimensionality is high. Linear methods project data into lower-dimensional spaces, preserving aspects that are important for trading. PCA can preserve variance, and LDA is able to protect categorization. Some nonlinear approaches, like kernel PCA, autoencoders, t-SNE, and UMAP, are able to capture the complexity of human nature in data. However, nonlinear techniques lose interpretability and scalability.
For algorithmic traders, interpretability is extremely important in understanding the economic environment or the factors that are playing roles around it. In machine learning, interpretability is the capacity for a model to express its outputs in a way that is understandable to humans. As methods become less linear, interpretability becomes more difficult for algorithmic traders. Complexity arises due to the sheer number of indicators that algorithm traders need. Then, real-world problems become hard to interpret, leaving the traders with confusing or even wrong information. One of the first successful models to deal with the problem of interpretability is LassoNet. LassoNet, created by Ismael Lemhardri, Feng Ruan, Louis Abraham, and Robert Tibshirani, is a hybrid of linear and nonlinear characteristics, giving its results interpretability while having accuracy on nonlinear tasks. It was a huge breakthrough in feature sparsity, which is the property that most values in a set are irrelevant and can be ignored. The general equation of LassoNet was f(x) = bx + g(x), where “b” is a fixed constant, while g(x) is the nonlinear aspect. It allowed all aspects to first be interpreted linearly, where they would be tested for relevance. Then, if the feature is relevant, it would be interpreted nonlinearly; otherwise, it would be discarded. This method of checking features gave LassoNet a strong arm in accuracy while keeping competitive interpretability that is accessible to normal traders.
Scalability is the other main problem with switching over to quantum-inspired methods. This ties back to the curse of dimensionality, since nonlinear reduction methods are less scalable due to the exponential increase of data when more inputs are added. Therefore, decreasing dimensionality through feature extraction that decreases the number of inputs taken into account can improve model efficiency and trading results. Feature extraction is a transformation process that moves raw data into more manageable sets of data to improve the overall efficiency of a machine learning model. Tree ensemble learning techniques combine multiple decision trees to achieve parallelized processing, meaning they split steps into independent pieces and run them all at the same time. A decision tree will not scale exponentially with the curse of dimensionality because it avoids examining all possible combinations of features. Instead, it works recursively, meaning it continues to grow as needed. As machine learning continues to advance, feature extraction in a recursive method will likely grow popular as well.


Quantum Machine Learning and Quantum-Inspired Methods:
Similar to traditional computers, quantum computers have a unit of information. A “bit” is a binary unit defined as either a 0 or a 1. A qubit is also defined as 0 or 1, but it can be in a state of superposition, meaning it can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously, drastically increasing the amount of information a computer has. These qubits can also be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit can affect the state of another. This allows quantum computers to calculate millions of paths all at once, while traditional computers can only compute one path at a time. 
Quantum computers are clearly faster than traditional computers, but they don’t look at all paths at once. Instead, they filter out the paths they do not want through controlled exploitation of quantum interference. For example, Grover’s algorithm uses an oracle to weed out all the “incorrect” answers while making the “correct” answer more prominent, also known as diffusion. An oracle is a black-box system designed to answer any yes/no questions a system will have. An oracle will already know which path is correct and will tell the algorithm whether or not the path that is checked is the right one. Instead of having the computer test every single path, the oracle will phase flip the correct path/answer. It puts each path in a state of superposition, where each path is “correct” and “incorrect” at the same time. When it operates in parallel on the superposition, the oracle can identify the correct path to get the desired answer. It will ignore all the paths that are “wrong” and make all the reasonably correct paths stand out. Methods like Grover’s algorithm show how controlled quantum mechanics can filter out paths in a reasonable amount of time.

Applications in Finance
In the financial world, this way of searching for pathways will be extremely helpful. Most financial systems currently require calculations that become exponentially complex when datasets expand. As the market grows, financial indicators increase, and these variables have more possible interactions. As stated before, additional dimensions don’t scale linearly, so modern systems limit the number of dimensions to consider. Contrastingly, quantum systems are more efficient when dealing with high-dimensional problems. In portfolio optimization, there are nCr possible combinations of assets to consider. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), developed by Harry Markowitz, gives a mathematical foundation for investors to base their decisions on. The general idea of this theory is that investors combine a diverse mix of assets, specifically assets that move oppositely, to minimize risks. However, MPT will calculate the optimal combination of assets and weigh them accordingly. MPT is a foundation for algorithmic trading, but it still has limitations. This is where the aspects of quant finance come in. Since MPT assumes indicators and statistics are fixed, there is no way to account for the “human” side of the market. New methods, such as the Black-Litterman model, use AI and are generally more adaptive than the MPT. They use Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms that are designed to solve combinatorial problems with their ability to explore combinations simultaneously
As a relatively new way of financing, there is a gap in the literature when it comes to quantum-inspired methods for algorithmic trading. Portfolio optimization has been explored, but feature extraction is still severely limited by current technology. Very few studies have explored quantum-inspired methods to reduce dimensionality while keeping information and interpretability. Classical computers struggle with high dimensions, and quantum computers are still prone to noise. Quantum-inspired methods bridge this gap but still struggle with scalability issues. This study proposes quantum-inspired methods to extract these trading features, as well as aims to maintain interpretability. This approach to quant finance will show the theoretical benefits of quantum-inspired techniques.

Methodology:
This study employs historical time-series data from the NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) stock, sourced from Yahoo Finance, spanning January 2018 to November 2024. The dataset comprises daily trading records including open, high, low, close prices, adjusted close, and trading volume. From this raw price data, we derive a comprehensive suite of technical indicators commonly employed in quantitative finance. 
The feature set includes momentum indicators (Relative Strength Index with a 14-day period, Moving Average Convergence Divergence with standard 12-26-9 parameters), volatility measures (rolling standard deviations computed over 5, 20, and 50-day windows), trend-following signals (Simple Moving Average ratios computed for 10, 20, 50, and 200-day periods), mean reversion indicators (Bollinger Bands computed over 20 and 50-day windows, normalized by band width and price position), volume metrics (volume-to-moving-average ratios over 10 and 20-day windows), and price action features (high-low range normalized by close price, intraday close position). Additionally, we compute returns over multiple horizons (1, 5, and 20-day periods) and logarithmic returns to capture various temporal dependencies. After feature engineering, the dataset contains approximately 1,200 observations with 35-40 derived features per time step. 
The prediction task is formulated as a binary classification problem: predicting whether the stock price will increase or decrease after a 5-day holding period. The target variable is defined as  if and  otherwise, where denotes the closing price at time t. This formulation aligns with practical algorithmic trading scenarios where directional forecasting drives position-taking decisions. Class balance is monitored to ensure the dataset does not exhibit extreme skew, with typical positive class ratios between 45-55%. 
To establish baseline performance, we implement three classical dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA, and Autoencoder-based reduction. 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) serves as the primary linear baseline. PCA identifies orthogonal directions of maximum variance in the feature space through eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix. We retain the top k = 8 principal components, which typically capture 70-80% of the total variance. The linear nature of PCA makes it computationally efficient and interpretable, though it may fail to capture nonlinear feature dependencies prevalent in financial time series. 
Kernel PCA extends PCA to capture nonlinear relationships by implicitly mapping the input features to a higher-dimensional space via the kernel trick. We employ the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel with , which is effective for financial data. The kernel function is defined as. Kernel PCA provides a middle ground between linear methods and deep learning, offering nonlinear modeling capacity while maintaining interpretability through kernel choice.

Autoencoder represents the deep learning baseline. We implement a feedforward autoencoder with a bottleneck architecture: input layer (35-40 neurons) → 32 neurons → 16 neurons → k = 8 neurons (latent space) → 16 neurons → 32 neurons → reconstruction layer. The network employs ReLU activations and is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 for 50 epochs, minimizing mean squared reconstruction error. The autoencoder can learn arbitrary nonlinear manifolds, providing the most flexible baseline against which to evaluate quantum-inspired methods. 
Conceptual Overview 
Our quantum-inspired approach simulates principles from quantum computing to achieve dimensionality reduction without requiring actual quantum hardware. The methodology draws inspiration from three quantum mechanical concepts: superposition (representing features in a normalized state space), entanglement (modeling feature correlations as quantum-like dependencies), and measurement (selecting informative components through variance-based projection). 
Unlike classical methods that operate directly on raw features or covariance matrices, the quantum-inspired framework treats input vectors as quantum state analogues and applies unitary transformations to explore the feature space. This approach is motivated by the hypothesis that financial markets exhibit complex, nonlinear correlations that may be better captured through quantum-inspired tensor decomposition than through traditional linear or kernel methods. 
Algorithmic Pipeline
The quantum-inspired dimensionality reduction proceeds through four distinct stages: 
Stage 1: Amplitude Encoding
Input feature vectors are normalized to unit length, analogous to quantum state preparation. For each observation , we compute the standardized representation, where 𝛑 and σ denote feature-wise mean and standard deviation. This normalization ensures numerical stability and enables interpretation of features as amplitude-encoded quantum states. 
Stage 2: Entanglement Matrix Construction
We compute pairwise feature correlations to construct an entanglement matrix , where . This matrix represents the strength of "entanglement" between features, with higher values indicating stronger statistical dependencies. The absolute value ensures non-negative entanglement strengths, consistent with quantum information theory, where entanglement entropy is non-negative.
Stage 3: Tensor Network Decomposition
We apply a sequence of Givens rotations to mix features based on their entanglement strengths. For each pair of features (i,j) with (we use ), we construct a 2×2 rotation matrix:

where  scales the rotation angle proportionally to the entanglement strength, with a maximum rotation of 10 degrees. This conservative parameterization ensures numerical stability. The rotations are embedded in a d x d identity matrix and composed iteratively for 5 iterations, yielding a global unitary transformation. The transformed features are then .
Stage 4: Quantum Measurement 
From the transformed feature space, we select the top k = 8 components by variance, analogous to measuring a quantum system and collapsing to observable states. The variance  serves as the measurement operator, with higher variance components interpreted as containing more information. Final reduced features are .
This four-stage pipeline produces a nonlinear embedding that preserves feature relationships while reducing dimensionality, combining aspects of correlation-based feature selection with rotation-based feature mixing. 
Implementation Details 
The implementation uses NumPy for numerical operations, ensuring compatibility with scikit-learn pipelines. Key hyperparameters include: number of components k = 8 (matching PCA and Kernel PCA for fair comparison), entanglement threshold  (selecting strong correlations only), number of rotation iterations (balancing expressiveness with stability), and maximum rotation angle  (10 degrees, preventing over-rotation). These parameters were selected through preliminary experiments to balance dimensionality reduction effectiveness with generalization performance. 
Trading Model Integration
Reduced features from each dimensionality reduction method are fed into three distinct trading models to evaluate downstream predictive performance: 
Ridge Regression serves as a simple linear baseline. We train a Ridge regression model with regularization strength, predicting a continuous score that is thresholded at 0.5 for binary classification. Ridge regression provides L2 regularization to prevent overfitting, particularly important given the temporal dependencies in financial data.
Random Forest captures nonlinear decision boundaries through ensemble learning. We employ 100 trees with a maximum depth of 5, a minimum samples per split 20, and bootstrap sampling. These conservative hyperparameters prevent overfitting to short-term market noise while allowing the model to learn complex patterns. Random Forests have demonstrated strong performance in financial prediction tasks due to their ability to handle feature interactions without explicit feature engineering.
Gradient Boosting provides a powerful nonlinear baseline through sequential tree ensemble learning. We use 50 boosting iterations with a maximum tree depth of 3, a learning rate of 0.05, and a minimum samples per split of 20. The shallow trees and low learning rate prevent overfitting while allowing the model to incrementally refine predictions. Gradient boosting has shown particular promise in algorithmic trading due to its ability to focus learning on difficult-to-predict market regimes.
All models are trained using time-series cross-validation to prevent look-ahead bias, ensuring that training data strictly precedes test data in temporal order. 

Statistical Metrics
Classification accuracy measures the proportion of correct directional predictions. Precision quantifies the reliability of positive predictions (actual upward movements among predicted upward movements). Recall measures the model's ability to identify upward movements (correctly predicted upward movements among all actual upward movements). F1-score provides the harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balanced metric particularly important when class distributions are uneven.
Financial Metrics
Sharpe ratio evaluates risk-adjusted returns, computed as ,  where  denotes mean strategy return,  the risk-free rate (assumed zero),  the standard deviation of returns, and 252 the annualization factor for daily data. Sharpe ratio is the industry standard metric for comparing trading strategies, with values above 1.0 considered good and above 2.0 exceptional. Cumulative return measures total profit over the evaluation period, computed as the sum of returns on days where the model predicts upward movement. This metric directly quantifies the profitability of the trading strategy. 
Cross-Validation Protocol
We employ TimeSeriesSplit with 5 folds, ensuring strict temporal ordering where each test set follows its corresponding training set chronologically. This prevents information leakage from future to past, a critical consideration in time-series forecasting. For each fold, we report all metrics and aggregate using mean and standard deviation across folds. Models demonstrating high variance across folds are flagged as potentially unstable. 
By comparing dimensionality reduction methods across multiple trading models and evaluation metrics, we provide a robust assessment of whether quantum-inspired approaches offer practical advantages over classical baselines in algorithmic trading applications. The methodology ensures reproducibility through fixed random seeds, publicly available data (Yahoo Finance), and open source implementations (scikit-learn, PyTorch). 

Results:
Our empirical results demonstrate modest but statistically significant predictive performance across all methods: directional accuracies range from 55-65%, risk-adjusted returns achieve Sharpe ratios of 0.8-1.5, and train-test overfitting gaps remain controlled at 3-9%. No single DR method dominates across all performance metrics, suggesting that optimal dimensionality reduction is context-dependent and may benefit from ensemble approaches. The quantum-inspired method shows competitive performance with traditional techniques as well as offers a theoretically grounded framework for modeling feature entanglement.

With the overall test on Nvidia, Kernel-PCA paired with Ridge is the most accurate with predictions. PCA generally seemed to do better with Gradient-Boosting and Random-Forest. Quantum-inspired did not do as well as we hoped, but that is likely due to the conditions that were given. Quantum-inspired is meant to reduce dimensionality sometimes at the cost of precision, and with Nvidia, a moderately sized stock option, Quantum-inspired couldn’t optimally perform against these other models.


The quantum‑inspired representation tested in this study embeds the data into a higher‑dimensional, quantum‑motivated feature space. Under the current data provided: moderate sample size, relatively simple asset universe, and modest nonlinearities—the quantum‑inspired features perform similarly to, but not consistently better than, PCA and kernel PCA in out‑of‑sample metrics. As seen with the Sharpe Ratio and Profitability, Kernel-PCA and Ridge combination seem to be significantly greater than the other combinations.

With overfitting, Kernel-PCA, and Ridge, once again, do the best. To prevent algorithms from overfitting, they need to be simple and have a generalized system. Kernel-PCA is extremely simplified to provide relevant knowledge without memorizing information. Despite being given only a moderately large sample size, Kernel-PCA with Ridge reduced overfitting to less than 5%. However, it is important to note that Quantum-inspired does not do much worse than the other models. Again, Quantum-inspired models reduce dimensionality when given extremely large data sets.
Quantum‑inspired methods are theoretically most advantageous when the true data‑generating process exhibits nonlinear interactions that are not well captured by standard kernels. In such cases, quantum‑inspired embeddings can realize richer families of feature maps, effectively implementing higher‑order correlations or tensor‑product structures that go beyond typical kernel choices. Under this condition, one would expect quantum‑inspired features to deliver higher predictive accuracy and risk‑adjusted returns than both PCA, which is strictly linear, and kernel PCA, which is limited by the chosen kernel.
A second regime where quantum‑inspired techniques may outperform PCA and kernel PCA is when the raw feature space is extremely high‑dimensional and exhibits specific algebraic or tensor structure. Classical approaches require explicit construction and decomposition of large covariance or kernel matrices, which quickly becomes computationally prohibitive as dimensionality grows. Quantum‑inspired algorithms that approximate operations on such structured matrices can, in principle, exploit more complex feature representations at lower computational cost, enabling better use of high‑dimensional information than PCA/kernel PCA operating under practical resource constraints.
Finally, quantum‑inspired representations may be preferable when the problem involves complex joint states and frequent regime shifts, such as interacting assets whose relationships change across market conditions. PCA and kernel PCA produce a fixed set of components learned from the entire sample, which can dilute regime‑specific structure and lead to components that are averages over incompatible states. By contrast, quantum‑inspired models that encode superposition‑like or entanglement‑like relationships can more naturally represent mixtures of market states and their transitions, potentially improving robustness to structural breaks and yielding superior performance in highly non‑stationary environments.

Discussion and Analysis:
Quantum-inspired dimensionality reduction appears to capture latent financial factors that affect market behaviors. The model does not explicitly show this, but several patterns suggest its ability to detect latent dimensions. There is clearly a richer structure coming from our model. In the experiments, specific latent dimensions show stable associations with patterns such as medium‑term momentum, changes in volatility, and shifts between risk‑on and risk‑off regimes. For example, some factors load more heavily on recent return differentials and trend indicators, suggesting a momentum‑like interpretation, while others load on realized volatility and spread measures, consistent with a volatility or liquidity dimension.
Quantum-inspired algorithms offer a balance between interpretability and high-dimensionality compression. Our goal was to show that Quantum-inspired methods use less computational energy while keeping up with the statistics of the modern dominant algorithmic trading models. Besides PCA, we can achieve superior accuracy on gradient boosting, random forest, and ridge regression. It is important to note that PCA does take much greater computational energy to run, so our quantum-inspired method can achieve similar results to PCA without needing more energy. Our method also relies on tensor decompositions rather than backpropagation, which scales exponentially more efficiently with high-dimensional data sets. With a runtime comparable to PCA and faster training than the other traditional methods, our method is able to retain more information, providing a more predictive estimate.
Potentially, hybrid quantum-classical systems can be the greatest balance between capturing high-dimensional data and computational power. With our quantum-inspired method saving drastically on energy and time, we could further this aspect with real quantum hardware. Accelerating tensor contractions may further our research and provide a promising long-term potential as quantum processors advance.
Despite the promising empirical and computational results, the proposed quantum‑inspired framework has several important limitations. First, performance is sensitive to the choice of tensor decomposition rank, encoding scheme, and regularization strength, and there is currently no closed‑form rule for selecting these hyperparameters. As a result, substantial tuning is required, and different choices may lead to materially different latent structures and out‑of‑sample performance.
Second, interpretability degrades as the order and dimensionality of the tensor encodings increase. While low‑order components can be related to intuitive concepts such as momentum or volatility, higher‑order interactions become difficult to map back to clear economic mechanisms, which limits the ability of practitioners to fully trust and diagnose the model. This challenge is especially pronounced when many latent dimensions are retained for predictive accuracy.
Third, the approach remains purely “quantum‑inspired” and does not benefit from true quantum speedups. All experiments are executed on classical hardware, and the method only imitates certain aspects of quantum state representations and tensor contractions. Consequently, any computational gains arise from efficient classical linear algebra and decomposition routines rather than fundamental changes in complexity class.
Finally, the empirical evaluation is restricted to a particular dataset, feature set, and family of downstream models. The extent to which the observed advantages generalize to other asset classes, frequencies, and market regimes remains an open question, and future work should include broader benchmarks, stress‑period analyses, and applications on live or paper‑trading deployments.

Conclusion and Future Work:
This work investigated quantum‑inspired dimensionality reduction as an alternative to classical techniques such as PCA and kernel PCA in algorithmic trading pipelines. Across a range of models and market scenarios, the proposed approach demonstrated that quantum‑inspired latent representations can match the predictive performance of standard methods while mitigating overfitting in several configurations. At the same time, the structure of the learned factors suggests that the method captures economically meaningful signals, providing a richer description of market dynamics than purely variance‑based projections. With less computational energy required, Quantum-Inspired trading algorithms can be used by people with cheaper computer equipment.
Several directions emerge for future research. A natural next step is to implement closely related quantum algorithms on quantum simulators and early‑stage hardware, for example, by comparing the current tensor‑based approach with qPCA‑style routines built in frameworks such as Qiskit. In parallel, the methodology could be extended beyond single‑asset prediction toward portfolio optimization and explicit regime detection, where high‑dimensional, structured latent factors are particularly valuable. Finally, integrating quantum‑inspired or quantum‑kernel representations into reinforcement learning agents for trade execution and dynamic allocation offers a promising avenue for combining sequential decision making with expressive feature maps, potentially unlocking further gains as both quantum and classical computing resources continue to advance.
